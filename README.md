# Filtering-an-image-with-High-pass-and-Low-pass-filters.
The high pass frequency components denotes edges whereas the low pass frequency components denotes smooth regions.
Hence when we apply High pass filter on an image, we will see edges of the input image as the output image.
And similarly with Low pass filter we will see blur/smooth image as an output.
